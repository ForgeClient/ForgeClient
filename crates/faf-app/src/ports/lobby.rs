//! Lobby port: a *bidirectional, streaming* boundary.
//!
//! Unlike [`AuthPort`](crate::ports::AuthPort) (request/response), the lobby pushes
//! data over time: `connect` returns a receiver that yields a [`LobbyUpdate`]
//! whenever the server's view changes. It is also bidirectional: [`Self::join`]
//! sends a `game_join` over the *same* authenticated connection, and the server's
//! `game_launch` / `game_join_failed` reply arrives back on the very same update
//! stream. The real impl wraps the FAF lobby WS protocol; the fake simulates it.
//! The service is identical against either.
