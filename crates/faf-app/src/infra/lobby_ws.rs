//! Real lobby provider: the FAF lobby WebSocket protocol.
//!
//! Connects to `wss://ws.faforever.com`, performs the session handshake and
//! streams the open-games list behind the same [`LobbyPort`] the fake implements.
//! The connection lifecycle (and graceful teardown via `disconnect`) lives here;
//! the lobby service, slice and UI are unchanged.
//!
//! ## Protocol
//! First, `GET {api}/lobby/access` (bearer token) returns `{ accessUrl }`: a
//! one-time verified `wss://…/?verify=…` URL (connecting to the bare host 403s).
//! Then, newline-delimited JSON messages (the Python client uses binary frames;
//! we accept/send the same wire form), keyed by `command`:
//!
//! 1. → `ask_session { version, user_agent }`
//! 2. ← `session { session }`
//! 3. → `auth { token, unique_id, session }`
//! 4. ← `welcome { me }` (or `authentication_failed`)
//! 5. ← `game_info { … }` / `game_info { games: [ … ] }`: pushed continuously
//!
//! ## `unique_id` (anti-smurf)
//! The lobby `auth` also requires a `unique_id`: a machine fingerprint produced by
//! FAF's `faf-uid` executable (we can't reproduce its encryption, but we don't need
//! to: we run the official binary). We invoke `faf-uid <session>` and use its
//! stdout. The binary path comes from `FAF_UID_PATH`; otherwise the provider
//! searches the development/package `natives` directory and finally `PATH`.
//! The live provider is selected for normal account sessions; without a working
//! `faf-uid`, lobby auth fails and the stream ends.
